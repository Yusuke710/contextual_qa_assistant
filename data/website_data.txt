 The bioacoustic monitoring project runs under the supervision of Bernd Meyer of Monash‚Äôs Department of Data Science & AI. The project aims to use AI techniques to help researchers track the health of our ecosystem by monitoring recorded bioacoustics data in the wild. The ‚Äòmonitoring‚Äô part is often tedious, as experts need to manually comb through hours of audio to identify and tag the animals they hear. This is where we come in! We focus on sound event classification and detection models that would help researchers to detect whenever an animal‚Äôs sounds occur and identify which animals it belongs to. This would allow the researchers to work on more meaningful yet smaller manageable chunks instead of the long audio recorded from nature. In collaboration with Dr. Wesley Chan and Dr. Pamela Carreno-Medrano from the electrical engineering department, the HRI project aims to handle the issue of crowd navigation for robots to perform critical tasks such as package deliveries or hospital assistance. The aim is to have an agent navigate through a crowd without getting lost or colliding with anyone, but also behave in a socially confirmative way such that the robot moves in a predictable way to avoid making humans stop, slow down, or alter their intended path of travel. The agent would have to learn to keep to the left (in Australia), yield to other pedestrians, avoid cutting through groups of people and a wide variety of other behaviours that humans take for granted but are hard to describe in words. Generative deep learning models look at learning data distributions to be able to reconstruct similar types of data from scratch. Generative art aims to explore and utilise generative models to create new art, generating abstract paintings or even Pok√©mon! Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are the most traditional and well-known types of generative models. However, a relatively newer class of generative models called diffusion models have shown great promise and has been rising in popularity.  As power networks play a pivotal role in maintaining our modern, technologically fueled society, the task of balancing the grid has become increasingly complex. The grid has evolved from almost entirely fossil fuel-based power generation to a wide variety of energy sources such as nuclear energy and renewables like wind and solar energy. Power Networks have to evolve to handle these varying types of energy sources, account for maintenance work, and more recently, the threat of adversarial attacks, while also handling physical limits of the grid. The L2RPN (Learning to Run a Power Network Challenge) competition aims to find a solution to the power network operation problem, by promoting AI to address the power network problem. This year‚Äôs competition has a focus on both robustness and trust. Our Monash competition team, composed of members from Monash Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence and Monash DeepNeuron, aims to combine the fields of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Optimization to create a safe and robust agent.

 DeepNeuron will be competing at IndySCC in November 2022 in order to win a place in the Student Cluster Competition (SCC), the world championship competition held at the International Supercomputing Conference. IndySCC is a High-Performance Computing (HPC) competition with inclusiveness and education of competitors in mind. It aims to reduce the barrier to entering HPC competitions and give all teams the opportunity to compete on equal footing, with the same hardware allocated to each team as well as support and education from HPC experts. During the competition, teams fight to obtain the greatest performance using a limited power budget on a series of real-world scientific applications, offering the HPC community creative and unique perspectives on how HPC problems can be solved. Technical Details: During the competition, the DeepNeuron team will be optimising the following applications for performance: NAMD: Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics (NAMD) is a molecular dynamics simulation software that simulates large complex systems of atoms and molecules. It is written using the Charm++ parallel programming model. miniVite: miniVite is a proxy application that implements a single phase of Louvain method in distributed memory for graph community detection. Mystery Application: At the start of the competition, teams will be given an application and datasets for a mystery application. Students will be expected to build, optimize and run this mystery application all at the competition. These optimisations will be then measured using the LINPACK benchmark, which is a measure of a computer‚Äôs floating-point rate of execution. More details about the benchmark can be found here: https://top500.org/project/linpack/ The energy system is at the forefront of efforts to mitigate climate change by integrating sustainable energy resources. With the increasing penetration of renewable generation, planning for operational flexibility along with generation and transmission capacities plays a vital role in ensuring the reliability of the energy system. The required operational flexibility is typically achieved through gas generators and energy storage systems, such as grid-scale batteries or pumped hydro, as they can respond instantly to rapid variations in renewable generation, preventing load and/or renewable curtailment. Therefore, it is essential to determine the optimal combination of generation, storage, and transmission investment decisions that meet the demand, renewable energy targets, provide flexibility, and achieve other necessary goals, such as system reliability. This project is contributing to the development of computational methods to determine the most cost-effective way to expand and transform the Australian electricity grid over the coming decades to meet these goals.  Previous work has developed a detailed generation, transmission, and storage expansion planning model. DeepNeuron is looking to explore how the existing and future models can benefit from distributed computing to scale up to larger problem sizes. Connected vehicles is a project which attempts to capture and send live data about a car to the web. This data has a range of applications from self-driving cars to traffic analysis and emissions tracking DeepNeuron aims to: Self-diagnose car dynamics in real-time using OBD (Onboard diagnostics). Track cars‚Äô real-time location and interact with nearby cars‚Äô location using Sparkfun GPS tracking. Track the live objects that come in the periphery of the car while driving i.e real-time object detection of objects like - Signboards, Animals, Traffic lights, buildings, etc. Interested in partnering with us on future projects?

 Reconstructing facial features from skeletal remains using CT scans Identifying skeletal remains is a challenging problem that requires both technical knowledge of bone and face structure as well as creative anatomical artistry. Traditionally this task has been undertaken by trained specialists who spend hours carving or drawing potential faces for criminal investigations, historical explorations, and disaster relief recordings.  Deep Neuron CT Facial Reconstruction aims to apply generative neural networks to automatically create realistic looking faces from skulls with no human interaction and in real-time. By using a dataset of 3D head CT scans, the team is exploring both 2D and 3D generative deep learning techniques to create a proof of concept. Determining the location of electrical failures in the power grid Current methods of determining the location of faults involve using sensors that only tell which region of the network the fault is or simulating the fault and checking against the true signal which is time-consuming. This project aims to use a machine learning approach to determine the location directly from the signal. Using Deep Learning as a means to improve male fertility outcomes. Assisted reproductive technologies such as IVF are faced with the challenges of low success rates and high cost. Traditional methods of sperm cell analysis and selection for IVF are costly, time-consuming, and require skillful clinicians who employ non-standardised procedures. The aim of the microfluidics project is to bring deep learning to the challenge of improving male fertility outcomes, by applying state-of-the-art machine learning technologies to sperm cell analysis and selection. This opens up exciting possibilities to create effective, and highly accurate tools with real-world applications for researchers and clinicians. The Chess team aims to develop an agent that would be able to compete at a high level amongst current chess players at Monash and further optimise the agent to the point of grandmaster level. Since its inception in the 6th century, chess has classically been viewed as a game of intellect, two opponents facing off in a battle of wits. This is why AI researchers have been enamoured with the game since the field‚Äôs beginnings. The approach taken involves a recreation of two distinct, well-known papers, AlphaZero and MuZero, to build the team‚Äôs intuition regarding general chess engine models at the highest level. The team will then begin to develop it‚Äôs own unique architecture for the agent to learn from to achieve our aim. Interested in partnering with us on future projects?  Contact us here
 The Monash M3 MASSIVE cluster has records of over 20 million jobs that have been submitted by users. Currently stored in a mySQL database it is difficult for a user to look at their past jobs without having to trawl through a wall of text, or extract any meaningful data. In order to increase productivity of M3 MASSIVE users, we are devising a new way to view job records so that better, more informed decisions can be made when submitting their next job. Analysing the bulk of these records is more easily achieved on a data analysis platform, which in our case will be NumPy and MatPlotLib on Python. Once exported to a separate program, trends can be drawn on key elements of the data such as computational resources allocated, wall (estimated) time vs actual time, and server traffic. The plan is to provide users with an interactive dashboard containing useful statistics on their usage, how many jobs they have submitted, etc - which may play in tandem with the ‚ÄòMonitoring the Cluster‚Äô project. While time may be limited, there are a plethora of implementations for this project - for instance, implementing machine learning to provide much more accurate estimates for job run time based on computation power necessary. This will increase the efficiency of the MASSIVE cluster and allow for better allocation of resources. Horovod is a distributed deep learning training framework that makes training models easier and faster. The main goal of this project is to implement Horovod on the Monash HPC cluster MASSIVE, and to develop training and documentation to enable users to easily train their deep learning models. We also aim to help make MASSIVE more accessible for users without technical backgrounds by identifying problem areas and documenting solutions. Monitoring the cluster is a visualisation project to display interesting and important data about the Monash M3 Cluster. The main goal of the project is to provide three tiers of information to different members of the HPC community. The synopsis allows for viewers to consume the detailed and technical information in a comprehensible manner. Open page The open page is a landing page that will have interesting information about the server in general. Any person has the ability to access this page and the information displayed will be classified as public. User page The user tier will provide specific information about submitted jobs in order for programmers to track their execution times, view server status and be notified when jobs are completed. Users will also be shown their position in the priority queue to understand their wait times. Devops page The devops page will provide admins with important user specific information that will allow them to support developers with failing jobs and also monitor excessive use of the M3 cluster. It is a goal of the project that by making information accessible, users are more easily able to find and fix important issues.
