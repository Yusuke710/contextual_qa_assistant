High Performance Computing Branch Description
High-performance computing (HPC) is a technology that harnesses the power of supercomputers or computer clusters to solve complex problems requiring massive computation.

High performance computing (HPC) generally refers to processing complex calculations at high speeds across multiple servers in parallel. Those groups of servers are known as clusters and are composed of hundreds or even thousands of compute servers that have been connected through a network. In an HPC cluster, each component computer is often referred to as a node.

HPC clusters run batches of computations. The core of any HPC cluster is the scheduler, used to keep track of available resources, allowing job requests to be efficiently assigned to various compute resources (CPU and GPU) via fast network.

A typical HPC solution has 3 main components:
Compute
Network
Storage

HPC solutions can be deployed on-premise, at the edge, or even in the cloud.
High Performance Computing Project Descriptions
INDYSCC:
DeepNeuron will be competing at IndySCC in November 2022 in order to win a place in the Student Cluster Competition (SCC), the world championship competition held at the International Supercomputing Conference.

IndySCC is a High-Performance Computing (HPC) competition with inclusiveness and education of competitors in mind. It aims to reduce the barrier to entering HPC competitions and give all teams the opportunity to compete on equal footing, with the same hardware allocated to each team as well as support and education from HPC experts.

During the competition, teams fight to obtain the greatest performance using a limited power budget on a series of real-world scientific applications, offering the HPC community creative and unique perspectives on how HPC problems can be solved.

Technical Details:
During the competition, the DeepNeuron team will be optimising the following applications for performance:
NAMD: Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics (NAMD) is a molecular dynamics simulation software that simulates large complex systems of atoms and molecules. It is written using the Charm++ parallel programming model.
miniVite: miniVite is a proxy application that implements a single phase of Louvain method in distributed memory for graph community detection.

Mystery Application: At the start of the competition, teams will be given an application and datasets for a mystery application. Students will be expected to build, optimize and run this mystery application all at the competition.

These optimisations will be then measured using the LINPACK benchmark, which is a measure of a computer’s floating-point rate of execution. More details about the benchmark can be found here: https://top500.org/project/linpack/

Energy HPC:
The energy system is at the forefront of efforts to mitigate climate change by integrating sustainable energy resources. With the increasing penetration of renewable generation, planning for operational flexibility along with generation and transmission capacities plays a vital role in ensuring the reliability of the energy system.

The required operational flexibility is typically achieved through gas generators and energy storage systems, such as grid-scale batteries or pumped hydro, as they can respond instantly to rapid variations in renewable generation, preventing load and/or renewable curtailment.

Therefore, it is essential to determine the optimal combination of generation, storage, and transmission investment decisions that meet the demand, renewable energy targets, provide flexibility, and achieve other necessary goals, such as system reliability. This project is contributing to the development of computational methods to determine the most cost-effective way to expand and transform the Australian electricity grid over the coming decades to meet these goals. 

Previous work has developed a detailed generation, transmission, and storage expansion planning model. DeepNeuron is looking to explore how the existing and future models can benefit from distributed computing to scale up to larger problem sizes.

Connected Vehicles:
Connected vehicles is a project which attempts to capture and send live data about a car to the web. This data has a range of applications from self-driving cars to traffic analysis and emissions tracking

DeepNeuron aims to:
Self-diagnose car dynamics in real-time using OBD (Onboard diagnostics).
Track cars’ real-time location and interact with nearby cars’ location using Sparkfun GPS tracking.
Track the live objects that come in the periphery of the car while driving i.e real-time object detection of objects like - Signboards, Animals, Traffic lights, buildings, etc.

HPP:
C++ is a powerful and robust programming language that enables users to develop fast, efficient and reliable software. Through this summer series, you'll learn the C++ programming language from variables, loops and conditionals, to Object Orientated design, to generic programming techniques, algorithm intuition and template meta-programming. You'll also explore how C++ allows you to effectively leverage your computers resources through parallelism, concurrent and asynchronous programming techniques.
